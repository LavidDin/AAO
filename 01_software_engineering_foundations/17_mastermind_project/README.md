#Mastermind project

A game of mastermind that generates a random sequence of colours based on a user entered length.
The possible colours consist of R(red), G(green), B(blue), Y(yellow).
The user attempts to guess the sequence and is given feedback on how many exact matches and near matches of each colour he correctly guesses. A near match means that the colour might be correct but is in a wrong position.
